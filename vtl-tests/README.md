=VTL Test Cases for Tools

This folder contains a collection of test cases intended to provide a prime attempt to create a VTL compatibility kit
It contains a series of category folders which in turn contain

* one folder with one or more related test cases for each of the VTL operators in that category;
* one folder with the input data sets used in those cases;
* one folder with the expected output for each of those cases.

The categories are defined as the "chapters" of the VTL Reference Manual:

* General purpose operators
* Join operators
* String operators
* Numeric operators
* Comparison operators
* Boolean operators
* Time operators
* Set operators
* Hierarchical aggregation
* Aggregate and analytic operators
* Data validation operators
* Conditional operators
* Clause operators
