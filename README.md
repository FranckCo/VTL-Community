# VTL Community

## Towards a community of VTL developers

### Vision

Several organizations are developing tools related to VTL. Coordinating these developments would bring more clarity for VTL users and avoid duplicating work.

In order to establish such a collaboration, it is proposed to set up a community based on the open source principles and methods.

### Members

The first members of the community are: Banca d'Italia, the European Central Bank and Insee (French Statistical Office). The community welcomes additional members.

### Objectives

The general objectives are interoperability and promotion of the VTL tools developed by the community members.

The following specific subjects have already been identified:

* design a standard REST API for VTL engines

* document the interoperability mechanism based on an abstract engine

* develop a test common framework, or even a conformance benchmark

* create communication material (guides, success stories, business cases) for the promotion of VTL tools
